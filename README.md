# Advent-of-code-2022

My progress on doing the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
It's my first time actively participating because last year I did it after the challenges were over.
This year though, I'm going for beating the whole 25 days.
I'll be trying to stay close enough to the daily progress, but that might be hard when exams come around later this month.
Here's to hoping I'm able to complete this month without losing motivation.
